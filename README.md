## A minimal portfolio template for Developers!

This is the cloned project. The original project is this : https://github.com/cobiwave/simplefolio

I have ported the project with the Yew Framework.

### Here are things to add.

1. adding theme context so I can switch from light theme to dark theme.
1. make scrolling action using use_ref.
1. adding more texting animation to Hero Section.
1. adding animation so things start to appear in view port.
1. study use_hook https://docs.rs/yew-hooks/latest/src/yew_hooks/hooks/use_scroll.rs.html#30-52
